# MobileDev-Spring21

Most of you will be working inside of the Pages/"your assigned page".

If you use any external Flutter Plugins or Packages please put them on the the extension.txt file in the main directory of the repository.

**UPDATE 3/5/2021**

None of the Flutter projects inside the Pages directory have been initialized. This means the app has not been built yet so when you get the chance, please clone the repository then "flutter run" it on your local machine. After you run it on your local machine, please use this order of git commands:

1. git status
2. git add Pages/{your page you're working on}
3. git commit -m "{Your message here informing team of any changes}"
4. git push
